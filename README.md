# Polluto

### Polluto is a real-time worldwide pollution tracker built in ReactJS, using geolocation, Google Maps API and AirVisual API.

This was the final project for my General Assembly course, December 2020. (And also my first project done in React!)

N.B.: The Polluto app can only take 5 API calls per minute, so pace yourself! ðŸ™ƒ
